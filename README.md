# grid-mazes

This repository is an interactive collection of grid-based mazes.

# Overview

Currently, the application will generate a random maze up to 4x4 squares in size.

The user will then be able to interact with the maze to draw a path leading from the start to the finish.

Obstacles in the maze will influence the path that must be taken to arrive at the exit.
